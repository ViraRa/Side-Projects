# Side-Projects
### Working on improving my python skills with side projects

**Project 1** - Randomly generate a number from 0 to 20, and the user needs to guess a number from this range. I guide the user to enter a number (not a string) from 0 to 20. I tell him/her if the number is too high or too low.
